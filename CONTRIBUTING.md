## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub to track public issues. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ivonunes/birdie/issues). It's that easy!

Great reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce. Be specific!
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes.

We *love* thorough reports.
